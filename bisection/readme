The bisection method for finding the root of a function at given area.

you have to add the bisection function into a main function and then you can use it.
this function works with C++ standard libraries.

"x1" is the beginning point and "x2" is the ending point of the given area.
and "c" is the difference between x1 and x2; c = |x1 - x2|.
Also, we control the answer's precision by using the d, 
and we define this variable as the following.
d = |func(x)|, where x is a variable and is found by x = (x1 + x2) * 0.5.
